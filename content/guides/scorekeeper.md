## Introduction

As with all officiating positions in roller derby, itâ€™s important to be aware that Scorekeeping is a combination of *what the rules explicitly say*, *how the rules are interpreted by the community*, and *common practices that are not rule-driven*.

Scorekeeping, in particular, is driven by the needs of the WFTDA Statsbook.

## The Basic Routine

Scorekeepers are typically seated on each side of the scoreboard operator, but the location of the score table varies from venue to venue.

Watch your Jam Referee and Jammer (in that order) during each jam. Follow the Statsbook Manual's instructions to record points and jam events (Lost Lead, Lead, Call, Injury, No Initial; Star Passes). **This guide deliberately does not cover the paperwork, because the Statsbook Manual is the authority**.

When each event happens, or when points are awarded, verbally communicate it to the Scoreboard Operator. The Scoreboard Operator will often echo this back to you to indicate that they received it.

For example, a jam might go like this:

> Jam Timer: *short whistle* to start jam.<br />
> *Play begins*<br />
> Jam Referee Blue: *two short whistle blasts* to indicate lead.<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: Blue lead<br />
> Scoreboard Operator: Blue lead, got it.<br />
> *Play continues*<br />
> Jam Referee Blue: *holds up three fingers*<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: *holds up three fingers* Three points Blue.<br />
> Scoreboard Operator: Three points Blue, got it.<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: *makes eye contact with Jam Referee Blue while signaling*.<br />
> Jam Referee Blue: *nods*<br />
> Referees: *signals star pass*<br />
> Scorekeeper Red: *Signals star pass*. Star pass red. New jammer is Red 052.<br />
> Scoreboard Operator and Scorekeeper Blue: Star pass red, got it.<br />
> Jam Referee Blue: *holds up four fingers*<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: Four points Blue.<br />
> Scoreboard Operator: Four points Blue, got it.<br />
> Scorekeeper Red: Red initial trip complete.<br />
> Scoreboard Operator: Red initial, got it.<br />
> Jam Referee Blue: *four short whistle blasts*<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: Blue call.<br />
> Scoreboard Operator: Blue call, got it. Total score is 109 Blue to 87 Red.<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: 109 blue confirmed.<br />
> Scorekeeper Red: 87 red confirmed.<br />

The conversation doesn't have to go exactly like this. Nobody needs to use these exact phrases. The scorekeepers could confirm the total rather than the scoreboard operator. Someone might miss an event and hear it from a colleague. 

What's important in this example is that the two scorekeepers and the scoreboard operator are *talking constantly*. They make sure that everyone has the information they need to do their jobs. They acknowledge that a game environment is noisy and fast-moving by acknowledging what they hear. And they make sure to confirm their most important job - keeping the visible score accurate - constantly, so that problems are caught right away while the rules still permit a correction.

Why call out these specific pieces of information?

* The Scoreboard Operator needs to know all of these events so that they can reflect them on the official scoreboard. Because they're monitoring both scorekeepers, they may not be able to collect all of the data themselves and rely on the scorekeepers to feed them data.
* The scorekeepers *both* record star passes for *both* teams. Since each scorekeeper is watching their own Jam Referee, they need to make sure their counterparts receive notice when a star pass occurs for the other team.
* Redundancy - the two scorekeepers plus that data in the scoreboard - increases the likelihood that a correct game record can be achieved during statsbook data entry. 

### End-of-Period and End-of-Game Responsibilities

At the end of each period, the scorekeeper should perform a series of steps to validate their points and paperwork.

1. The jam referees should visit the score table to confirm the recording of the last jam's score. Points may be corrected only for the final jam.
2. The scorekeeper totals all of the Trip columns to the bottom row, and verifies that the sum of the Trip columns is equal to the sum of the Jam Total column. If the game is over, also verify that this sum plus the carried-over Period 1 score is equal to the displayed final score.
3. The scorekeeper calculates the Period 2 total to provide to the Head NSO for the IGRF.

## Communication

### Jam Referee

Your Jam Referee will signal points to you starting when the jammer leaves the Engagement Zone (TODO reference). Many Jam Referees will continue to signal until the jammer enters the Engagement Zone for their next scoring trip. You should do the same. Remember that your signal may be seen by others throughout the venue, not just by your Jam Referee confirming that you've caught the points.

You do not need to echo other signals, such as the Lead sign. Some scorekeepers do, but it may provoke confusion. If in doubt consult with your Jam Referee.

There is no standardized hand signal for "no initial trip". There are several widespread conventions with more or less equal popularity. You should always ask your Jam Referee before the game how they signal a "no initial" to you, and be prepared to echo using the same signal.

There is no standard signal for "a star pass occurred". It is very common for referees and NSOs based in the center of the track to signal this by touching their hands and raising their hands repeatedly, sometimes with a plucking motion. This may indicate a star pass for *either* team. You may echo this signal but don't need to.

*Always* make sure that your co-scorekeeper and scoreboard operator are aware of the star pass.

Situations where an illegal or incomplete star pass occurs can be quite confusing. You should always watch and take your cues from your Jam Referee. TODO: elaborate

## Paperwork Beyond the Manual

Many experienced scorekeepers go beyond what's specified in the Statsbook Manual.

It's a good idea to always write down your pivot's number in the margin of your score sheet, to the left of the Jam column. This ensures that when a star pass occurs, you have the information at hand. It also allows your paperwork to support the Penalty Lineup Tracker's during statsbook data entry.

Some scorekeepers use "Dot System". Dot System is a way to annotate your paperwork with more information about the progress of the jam, which can help you keep track of scoring trips. This guide deliberately does not cover Dot System. You can read about it [here](TODO). We neither encourage nor discourage the Dot System. We encourage reviewing it and experimenting to find what makes you most effective.

## Score Corrections

Mistakes happen all the time. Roller derby is not a precise science!

* During the first period and during the first 28 minutes of play in the second period, you may make a correction to the score *until the end of the following jam*.
* During the final two minutes of play in the second period, you may make a correction to the score *until the following jam starts*. That is, you can only correct a jam's score during that jam and during the following lineup period, barring any stoppage of play.

What if there's a math error that you do not catch in time to fix it?

You shouldn't have to worry about math, in general. If you're verifying totals with the scoreboard operator every single jam, you'll constantly have your math validated by the computer.

It's unusual for scorekeepers to lose track of the jam number, because their paperwork involves making an entry every single jam. If you do, however, check against the scoreboard to get back on track.

WHat if I never see a jammer's number (for example, a jam that ends almost instantly)?

What if my jam referee does not signal points to me, I miss points?

What if I disagree with my jam referee's points count?

## Pragmatics and Training

It's very common for scorekeepers to have limited experience in the position. Crews that are short on non-skating officials will press skaters or jam referees into scorekeeping duty. Many scorekeepers are trained primarily at practices and scrimmages, where the scoreboard may not be used and the full team of scoreboard operator and other scorekeeper are not available.

In many cases, but certainly not all, the scoreboard operator is a more experienced non-skating official. (The scoreboard is not difficult to operate, but has many challenges and edge cases). If that's your situation, take advantage of their expertise. Draw on your other scorekeeper too, or lend them your expertise if they need it. However, always make sure to do your own job first.

When the NSO crew is very limited, it's possible to go with a single scorekeeper and a scoreboard operator. In extreme circumstances, it's possible even to have the scoreboard operator catch points for both teams. While this situation *could* meet the standards for a sanctioned game (which does not require a specific position count for NSOs), it's very risky and not recommended.
