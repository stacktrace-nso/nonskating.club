## Goals

The goals of this project are of two kinds: what kind of content we aim to provide for officials, and how we want to make that content accessible.

We want our guides to:

- Provide authoritative, up-to-date guides to non-skating officials covering everything they need to know to succeed in officiating high level play.
- Always start from and defer to official WFTDA, JRDA, and MRDA resources.
- Clearly distinguish between the rules and procedures and officiating conventions.

The Guides are newly-written starting in 2024 from the latest edition of the Rules of Flat Track Roller Derby. Each guide displays its last-updated date. We strive not to duplicate resources from the sport's governing bodies, but to collate, contextualize, and apply them in practice.

We also want our guides to:

- Be accessible and discoverable via the public web, not hidden in document platforms or file-sharing sites.
- Be open to contributions, corrections, and updates from the community.
- Be clearly licensed and allow modification and reuse.
- Be usable wherever officials want them, in print or on any device.

To those ends, the Non-Skating Official Guides are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1) license, which grants users broad freedom to edit, reuse, and repurpose them without cost. The guides are [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/davidmreed/nonskating.club), a standard platform for collaboration. We offer [instructions](@/contributing.md) for contributing to the project.

Each guide offers:

1. a web-based version with a bookmarkable, permanent link.
1. a PDF version that includes the guide's last-updated date and permanent URL to ensure users can find the latest resource.
1. an EPUB version that can be used with e-readers.

Guides are currently available only in English because the authors only write English. We welcome [contributions of translated content](@/contributing.md).
